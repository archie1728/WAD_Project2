## Project Description
Our Personal Trainer App is a Web App built on NextJS designed to help users book appointments with personal trainers. Our application allows trainers to efficiently schedule, update, and track their appointments with clients, while also managing their availability by adding busy dates. Admins are able to manage all users and appointments, admins can also edit or create users, or trainers.
